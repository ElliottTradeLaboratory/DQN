<p>It is very simple way to create a Deep Q-network (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2015) with the same performance as DQN3.0 (DeepMind, 2017), just create it in the same creation manner as DQN3.0.  But as far as I know, there is no anywhere to explanation of simplest way as above, and also its implementation is nowhere.  So I studied the DQN creation manner in DQN3.0, and succeeded create DQNs with DQN3.0-level performance.  This article is explained the creation manner of DQN in detail and how to implement a DQN with DQN3.0-level performance using Python with major deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, MXNet, Tensorflow and CNTK (the last two uses Keras)  through the creation manner of DQN.  After that, is proved that, we can get a DQN with DQN3.0-level performance, as a result.  In addition, also explains a very important aspect which is indispensable for that purpose but, although not explained so far        </td>
