<p>It is very simple way to create a Deep Q-network (DQN) (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236">Mnih et al., 2015</a>) with the same performance as <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/dqn">DQN3.0</a>, just create it in the same creation manner as DQN3.0.&ensp;But as far as I know, there is no anywhere to explanation of simplest way as above, and also its implementation is nowhere.&ensp;So I studied the DQN creation manner in DQN3.0, and succeeded create DQNs with DQN3.0-level performance.&ensp;This article is explained the creation manner of DQN in detail and how to implement a DQN with DQN3.0-level performance using Python with major deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, MXNet, Tensorflow and CNTK (the last two uses Keras)  through the creation manner of DQN.&ensp;After that, is proved that, we can get a DQN with DQN3.0-level performance, as a result.&ensp;In addition, also explains a very important aspect which is indispensable for that purpose but, although not explained so far.
